/*
An alternative method to procedural programming is object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a paradigm where objects containing data
and methods play a central role.

We can define what data and methods objects of some type will contain by defining classes.

We can have any amount of objects (instances) of any class.



Some of the issues potentially faced with procedural programming are as follows:
1. We will be more likely to write spaghetti code (untidy, complicated, hard-to-follow code), which is an antipattern.
2. We have no control over who can and cannot access methods, because no methods are encapsulated within methods with levels of protection.
3. There is no separation by levels of abstraction, meaning code is much more difficult to maintain with changing requirements.
4. Logic is not easily configurable due to the complexity of the code.

Some benefits of OOP:
1. Code is modular, making it easier to resuse, maintain, and modify.
2. Code is flexible, meaning we can change its behaviour easily.
3. Code is easier to understand.
4. Code is less prone to error given how we can control how methods and data are accessed.

There are 4 fundamentals of OOP:
1. Inheritence.
2. Polymorphism.
3. Abstraction.
4. Encapsulation.
